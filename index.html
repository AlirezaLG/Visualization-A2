        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <div>

            <p>
                In this assignment, you will apply multi-attribute data visualizations and
                practice to implement interaction techniques (manipulation, faceting, reducing)
                to create an interactive coordinated multi-view.
            </p>

            <p>
                To let you apply your theoretical visualization skills, the task will only define
                affordances. You will yourself decide which way to apply them. Please, be able to
                defend your choices in visualization terms.

            <h3>Task</h3>
            <p>
                Design and implement an interactive, coordinated multi-view on the penguin dataset in <b>"data/penguins.csv"</b>.
                The interactive visualizations should work towards answering the following questions:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>How many of each penguin species live on which of the three islands?</li>
                <li>How can the three different penguin species be distinguished?</li>
                <li>Are the penguins' quantitative attributes dependent on the island?</li>
                <li>Do male and female penguins differ in their quantitative attributes? Is this difference the same for
                    all species?
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>

            <h3>Affordances</h3>
            <p>
                The interactive, coordinated multi-view should have the following features:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    At least one heatmap and one scatter plot (25%).
                </li>
                <li>
                    At least three interaction techniques (50%):
                    <ol>
                        <li>At least one interaction that leads to manipulation</li>
                        <li>At least one interaction that leads to faceting</li>
                        <li>At least one interaction that leads to reducing</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Transitions between different states of the same visualization (15%).
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                You are <b>not</b> allowed to use html control elements like checkboxes, sliders, or select boxes to
                trigger interactions.
                All interactions should be designed using visual elements of your charts.
            </p>
            <p>
                You may create additional svgs to accommodate your different visualizations.
            </p>

            <p>
                <i>Hint: We didn't cover many kinds of interactions, yet. In the learning models, you can learn about
                    click, mouse enter, mouse leave and custom events. You can apply your skills from the module to implement the interactions.
                </i>
            </p>

            <p>
                Please, describe and defend your visualization and interaction design in the <b>"design_choices.md"</b>
                (10%).
