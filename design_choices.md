### Visualization design
1. **How many of each penguin species live on which of the three islands?**
Based on the requirements in the task 1, we have two categorical features ( Islands, Species) along with one quantitative feature representing the total number of each species on each islands. This makes the heatmap graph appropriate for visualizing the data. 

2. **How can the three different penguin species be distinguished?**
Based on the below **quantitative features** we can distinguish the penguins. 
- Bill_length_mm  
- Bill_depth_mm
- Flipper_length_mm
- Body_mass_g 
This makes the scatter plot an appropriate choice for visualizing the data. 


3. Are the penguins' quantitative attributes dependent on the island?

Do male and female penguins differ in their quantitative attributes? Is this difference the same for all species?

### Interaction design
[describe which interactions are possible in terms of manipulating, faceting, and reducing the data and how they are triggered]
